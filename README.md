website
This repository gives you the code you'll need to kickstart a personal website that showcases your work as a software developer.
And when you manage the code in a GitHub repository, it will automatically render a webpage with the owner's profile information, 
including a photo, bio, and repositories.
Your personal website is waiting to be personalized, though. It includes space to highlight your specific areas of interest in 
software development, like languages or industries. And it's standing by to publish your next great blog post.
It's all possible using the combination of Jekyll (for building your website), GitHub Pages (for hosting your website), and 
GitHub's API (for automatically populating your website with content).
The changes have been made.
